# odin-tic-tac-toe
In this project I made a tic-tac-toe game you can play with someone or against the computer. The player vs computer offers three difficulty settings:
  - easy, where the computer makes a random legal move
  - hard, where the computer makes the best possible move, which makes the game unwinnable for the player
  - medium, where the move is determined either by the easy or hard algorythm
The best move is calculated using a simple system that considers which signs are placed in the spots in the line, assigns the value to each spot, then chooses the one with the highest value.
